# Alien-Invasion (23.10.2022)
My second GitHub project. I started its developing on October 23rd when I was reading 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes (my project is the one of three projects in this book). So these materials have given me the foundation I'm working with. Making a game really gives me pleasure!

It's a game called 'Alien Invasion' and it's actually based on Space Invaders (shoot 'em up game released in 1978). The game has a spaceship controlled by the player and it can shoot at enemy spaceships approaching the player. The speed of the game increases as the level increases. The game is still under development, new mechanics are appearing as new ideas come to my mind!

The project contains 'audio' and 'images' folders and several files:
- alien.py (alien settings);
- alien_invasion.py (main file of the game, run this file to play the game);
- bullet.py (bullet settings);
- button.py ('Play' button settings);
- game_stats.py (game statistics);
- high_score.json (the highest score is written here);
- scoreboard.py (score information displaying);
- settings.py (game settings);
- ship.py (ship settings).

In addition to Eric Matthes' main codebase, I've added backgrounds that change with each new level, deathkllr84 music, and sounds of destruction for a better experience. 
The backgrounds are arranged in a way that allows me to imagine the plot. That's what I'll write next.

## THE PLOT
The far future. Until a certain time, there were no conflicts between humanity and extraterrestrial beings.

However, the aliens declared war on humanity and attacked outer space. Aliens attacked the Earth and opened interplanetary gap. Now the galaxy space doesn't limit them.

You're the one of the space warriors of International Space Army. You need to repel their attack on the Earth. Then get inside the gap and clear it of aliens. Once this is done, destroy as many aliens in space as possible. There is a world's destiny in your hands...
